Now:

- Get resolution info for image

- Check, which image types contain information, that can be returned by
  image_info()

- Rewrite template pages in HTML5

- Support Videos

- Trim get_imageinfo() -> last loop seems to be wrong. Either ... =value and
  then fix value depending on the key or a big if elsif else loop.

- Man-page

- Use the sizes to provide an image in this size which can be used by an
  <img src=.../> link.


Later:

- Add internationalisation - for HTML sites and image information

- Make the output much more flexible

- Introduce a sorting variant in the directory overview?

- Allow several style types of overviews (List with sorting info, pictures
  only, etc.pp.)
